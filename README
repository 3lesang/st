st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Installing st on Arch Linux
All you need to do is to download the PKGBUILD from this repository.  Then run the following command:

makepkg -cf

This will create a file that ends in .pkg.tar.zst (for example, st-git-6.2-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst).  Then run:

sudo pacman -U *.pkg.tar.zst

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info
